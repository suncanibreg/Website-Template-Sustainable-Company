  <p>How to live in accordance with nature? How to respect the inheritant rules of our environment?
    The basic thing is to do and create. To live. To live actively in that way which will return our accordance 
    with the life arround us. Originally, People like every other creature lived in acordance with life arround them selves. 
    The most of today's observation came to opiniion that human been was that who started ruining of
    life balance and accordance on our planet. in our world.
    
    So, logically, we should, in nowdays, to strugle tro live in acordance to origin 
    life rules, natural life rules. 
    Fromthis point of view, we can classified people and comunities in two groups. We can differ people who live in nature and who live in villages and cities. 
    The first group often consiously work to live natural life, as far as they know. The other goup also have many people who work to live 
    more naturally, than was it in earlier periods of time. But because general materialistic hurry for wealth and money don't let them to 
    separate themselves from the main stream. So usually they don't make it. In that urban group are also
    people who live in accordance to main stream way of life. 

    Intentionally, we don't need to explane causes and history of the urban or mainstream way of living.
    It is well known to all of us. Important is that the main cause of main stream power is the loosing feeling for
    nature and surrounding live creatures. As a consequence it evolves the love to material, human made things, so called material things. Further, from that materialistic love it evolves greed. Along with lack of natural feeling and greed it evolves selfish and proudness. People created practically "ideologies" or "philosophies" of materialistic love and worth of proudness and greed. Most of motivation programs for mutual become rich, make expanding business or similar ones are practical examples, appluying of those ideologies. 
    And Now we fight/or try to against the power of gred and prowdness when they had build machinery, complex and agressive system on global level.

    Conscious on that many individuals simply go to nature onr lonely litle villages ande live naturaly, as muchas they know.
    The most, hoever live in the cities and acomodate themselves in modern speedy life. But that life is full of stress, confusing, illness, conflict in all areas,
    sudden crashes, and often redefinitions off our awareness and strategies, individual at first place.
